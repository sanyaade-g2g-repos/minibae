**What is miniBAE?**

The platform-neutral Beatnik Audio Engine, Mini Edition (miniBAE) is an exceptionally mature, well-rounded, and reliable computer music and sound system specially customized for small-footprint and embedded applications.

miniBAE is...

**Flexible**

It can play several leading industry-standard music and audio file formats from disk or from memory.

**Interactivity-oriented**

You can pause and resume any media playback at will, change pitch while a sound is playing, etc.The feature-rich miniBAE API is full of opportunities for innovative integration of sound design into interactive virtual worlds– for example, miniBAE includes a MIDI synthesizer that your application – or user – can play in real-time.

**Great-Sounding**

The audio engine DSP quality is very good, comparable to high-end PC wavetable sound cards even though the processing is entirely software-based, and audio quality is selectable all the way from 8-bit 8 kHz up to 16-bit 44.1 kHz.

**Powerful and Extensible**

The miniBAE music synthesizer is a high-quality wavetable instrument with LFOs, ADSRs, and filters. It can be delivered with a complete General MIDI patch bank, or for small footprints a ‘light’ General MIDI approximation can be used. Custom instrument banks can be built with the Beatnik Editor application.

**Efficient**

Despite miniBAE’s power, the per-voice processor load is impressively low.

**Hardware Independent – Sound Card-Agnostic**

Some other sound systems require consumers to buy expensive (and quickly out- dated) hardware sound cards – but miniBAE avoids nearly all sound card support issues because it’s 100% software. miniBAE requires no particular sound hardware in the host system, only an audio output.

**Consistent Across Platforms**

Because it’s a software-only solution, consistently great-sounding music is much easier to achieve with miniBAE than with many other computer music systems.

**An Inexpensive Cross-Platform Audio Solution**

miniBAE provides the same music and sound capabilities on every supported plat- form, so porting music and sound content is a no-brainer, requiring literally no additional sound artist work – simply re-use the files.

Everyone on this list made a contribution in some important way. Its amazing to me that two scruffy guys working in our house created something that went around the world and in lots of peoples pockets.

Thank you all.
