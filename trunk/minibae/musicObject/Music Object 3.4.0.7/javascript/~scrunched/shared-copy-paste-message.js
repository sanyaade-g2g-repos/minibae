In cases where this example code is offered as copy-and-paste templates for seeding your own sonified pages, a \'Copy-and-Paste\' tag will appear in the top left corner of the block.<P>Example code in blocks like this is deliberately shown as pre-formatted text so that copying and pasting will not add undesired line breaks in the middle of lines of JavaScript code, leading to possible JavaScript syntax errors in your pages. A side effect of this formatting, however, is that you may at times have to scroll horizontally to see the full code. It\'s more important to us that copying and pasting example code from this documentation provide you with usable pages.</FONT>','CLOSE');}
