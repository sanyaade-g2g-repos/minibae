<BR>

<P>If you've been authoring using a version of Music Object before 3.3.0 and would now like to upgrade to the latest version, there may be some features of the older version of Music Object that you were using that are no longer supported in the recent version. Several changes to the API were made between version 3.2.x and version 3.3.0. You should consult the <A HREF="../../version-history/index.html?versions/version-3.3.0.html" TARGET="_parent">Music Object Version History</A> to find out more about the changes in version 3.3.0 and how they may affect your code.</P>

<P>If you find that your code will, indeed, be affected by the changes in the API, then you have two options...</P>
<OL>
	<LI><A HREF="../../version-history/index.html?from-3.2.x-to-3.3.x.html" TARGET="_parent">make the necessary changes</A> to your code and switch over to version 3.3.0, or...
	<LI>switch over to version 3.3.0 without changing your code and use this extension to mask the differences so that your code still works.
</OL>

<P>Of course, if none of the changes between versions 3.2.x and 3.3.0 affect your code, then you can make the switch to 3.3.0 without worries.</P>

<P>Among the things that this patch does,...</P>
<UL>
	<LI>It defines all of the Music Object 3.2.x extensibility API's global functions, so that versions of Music Object extensions that were written for Music Object 3.2.x can also work with Music Object 3.3.0. If this patch is not used, then it is necessary to use the very latest versions of all Music Object extensions (which have all been updated to work correctly with Music Object 3.3.0).
