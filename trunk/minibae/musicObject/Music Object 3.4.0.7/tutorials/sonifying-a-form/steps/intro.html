<P>In this tutorial, we will take a fictitious band named "Blue Bass & the Neurotic Fishes" and create a sonified merchandise form where loyal fans can order / purchase trinkets, paraphernalia, and music. We will not take the contents of this page all that seriously (as you'll see in the next step of this tutorial) and will simply use this Web page for this hypothetical group of aquatic musicians as an illustration of some simple sonification behaviors that can be added to forms, using the event handlers that are supported for form elements.</P>
