<P>This part of the tutorial will show in the most basic way how one can use the Music Object API's callback capabilities to achieve two-way connection between player instances and elements of an HTML page.</P>

<P>Because of these callback capabilities, it is even possible to create your own elaborate custom interface for player instances that exactly matches the desired aesthetics for your sonified Web pages. Of course, in this tutorial we will only go as far as to demonstrate the principles behind the way callbacks work, and we will leave it up to your imagination to find cool ways to apply these principles in your sonified Web content.</P>
