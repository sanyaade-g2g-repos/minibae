<P>One of the great features of the Beatnik Player is its ability to play multiple files at the same time. However, this very feature can be a liability when one wishes to embed multiple music files with control panels on the same HTML page, allowing the user to preview music compositions. It is typically not appropriate to be playing two completely different songs at the same time - kind of like having one's Stereo Tuner and TV set playing full blast in the same room. We will use the Music Object callback methods to create a layout where only one Beatnik player can play at a time.</P>
