TestSuite Build notes

9/28/2000

There are six project build types:

Win32 Complete
	This builds a single CPU windows application. This is the complete MiniBAE
	running as one application.
	This project defines BAE_BOTH and all the code compiled is combined in the
	correct way.

Win32 DSP
	This builds the DSP side of the codebase. This project defines BAE_DSP and
	all the code that is required here is compiled into a standalone DSP audio
	render application. Run this first to play with the dual CPU test cases.

Win32 MCU
	This builds the MCU side of the codebase. This project defines BAE_MCU and
	all the code that is required here is compiled into a standalone MCU
	TestSuite application. This application behaves just like the "Complete" build
	except its sending messages to the DSP to perform actions.

Win32 Complete MPEG
Win32 DSP MPEG
Win32 MCU MPEG
	These are the same as the above, except for the inclusion of the MPEG code. See the
	MiniBAE Build Notes.txt for details about MPEG.

The TestSuite_VC6.mak and TestSuite_VC6.dep are the makefile and dependancy
file. For building outside of Visual Studio 6.

Look at the file MsgHandle.c for the DSP message handling system. Look at DSPMain.c
for the main loop for the DSP.
